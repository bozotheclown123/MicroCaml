# MicroCaml 

A lexer, parser, and interpreter for MicroCaml -  â€” a *dynamically-typed* version of OCaml with a subset of its features.

Run the command `dune exec bin/mutop.exe` in your terminal or use the shell script `bash mutop.sh` to start the mutop toplevel.

For an example, refer to the folder 'assets' -> 'ex.gif'.
